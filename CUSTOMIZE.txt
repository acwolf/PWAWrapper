# QUICK CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE

### 1. GET STARTED (Required)
To set up your project identity and connection, complete these two steps:

A. SET THE PACKAGE ID:
Open 'app/build.gradle.kts' and update 'applicationId' (e.g., "com.yourname.project").

B. SET THE API URL:
Open 'local.properties' in the project root and add this line:
api.url="https://api.yourdomain.com"
(Note: This file is ignored by version control to keep your endpoints private).

Once finished, go to 'Build > Rebuild Project'. The app will use this address as 'BuildConfig.BASE_URL'.

### 2. UI CUSTOMIZATION
Use these locations to change the look and feel of the app:

* App Name: Change 'app_name' in 'res/values/strings.xml'
* App Icon: Right-click 'res' folder -> New -> Image Asset
* Colors: Edit 'res/values/themes.xml' (Update 'colorPrimary' and 'colorSecondary')

### 3. HOW TO ADD AN API KEY (Optional)
If you need to add a secret API key (for Stripe, Maps, etc.) follow these three steps:

Step A: Add the key to 'local.properties':
my.api.key="your-secret-key-123"

Step B: Register it in 'app/build.gradle.kts' inside 'defaultConfig':
val mySecret = properties.getProperty("my.api.key") ?: "\"default\""
buildConfigField("String", "SECRET_KEY", mySecret)

Step C: Access it in your Kotlin code:
val key = BuildConfig.SECRET_KEY
